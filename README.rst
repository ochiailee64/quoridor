Quoridor
========

Quoridor_ is a 2- or 4-player strategy game that emphasizes logical reasoning.
The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach the opposite side
of the board. On a turn, a player may either move his or her pawn or place a
wall, which blocks the path of pawns and forces pawns to move around them.

- 9x9 game board

Rules
=====

Game play is fairly simple, and the rules are summarized below. Complete rules
are available online in case clarification is required.

Each player places a pawn in the center of the row on his or her side of the
board. Walls are divided equally among the players (10 each for 2 players, 5
each for 4 players).

On a turn, a player may perform one of the following actions:

* Move his or her pawn to an adjacent square, horizontally or vertically (but
  not diagonally)
* Place a wall horizontally or vertically between 2 sets of 2 squares as long
  as that wall does not block a pawn's only remaining path to the side of the
  board it is trying to reach

If the player has no more walls, the player must move his or her pawn.

Pawns must move around walls; they cannot "jump" over them.

When two pawns occupy adjacent squares, a player may "jump" over the opponents
pawn, thus advancing an extra space. If a wall is behind the other pawn, then
the player may move to the left or right of the pawn (but not jump over the
wall).

The first player whose pawn reaches the opposite side of the board from which
it started is the winner.
